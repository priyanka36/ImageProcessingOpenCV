The first argument is the image we want to draw our rect-
angle on. We want to draw on our canvas, so we pass it into
the method. The second argument is the starting ( x, y ) po-
sition of our rectangle – here, we are starting our rectangle
at point ( 10, 10 ) . Then, we must provide an ending ( x, y )
point for the rectangle. We decide to end our rectangle at
( 60, 60 ) , defining a region of 50 × 50 pixels. Finally, the last
argument is the color of the rectangle we want to draw.
Just as we can control the thickness of a line, we can also
control the thickness of a rectangle. Line 18 provides one
added argument: the thickness. Here, we draw a red rect-
angle that is 5 pixels thick, starting from point ( 50, 200 ) and
ending at ( 200, 225 ) .
