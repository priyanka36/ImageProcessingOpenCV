Normally, we think of images in the RGB color space â€“
the red pixel first, the green pixel second, and the blue pixel
third. However, OpenCV stores RGB images as NumPy ar-
rays in reverse channel order. Instead of storing an image
in RGB order, it instead stores the image in BGR order; thus
we unpack the tuple in reverse order.
