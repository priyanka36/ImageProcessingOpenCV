Why do we change color spaces?

While RGB is easy to understand (especially when you’re first getting started in computer vision), it’s unintuitive when defining exact shades of a color if you need to define a particular range of colors (useful when tracking objects in a video stream based on color appearance).

The HSV color space tends to be more intuitive in terms of actually defining a particular color (or range), but it doesn’t do a great job of representing how humans see and interpret color.

Then we have the L*a*b* color space — this color space tries to mimic the methodology in which humans see and interpret color. This implies that the Euclidean distance between two arbitrary colors in the L*a*b* color space have actual perceptual meaning.

The addition of the perceptual meaning property makes the L*a*b* color space less intuitive and easy to understand than RGB or HSV, but because of the perceptual meaning property, we often use it in computer vision.

For example, we can apply the L*a*b* color space and the k-means clustering algorithm to find the dominant colors in an image:
