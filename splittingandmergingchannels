A color image consists of multiple channels: a Red, a Green,
and a Blue component. We have seen that we can access
these components via indexing into NumPy arrays. But
what if we wanted to split an image into its respective com-
ponents?
As you’ll see, we’ll make use of the cv2.split function.
For the time being, let’s take a look at a sample image in
Figure 6.11.
We have an image of a wave crashing down. This image
is very “blue” due to the ocean. How do we interpret the
different channels of the image?
The Red channel (Top-Left) is very dark. This makes sense,
because an ocean scene has very few red colors in it. The
red colors present are either very dark, and thus not repre-
sented, or very light, and likely part of the white foam of
the wave as it crashes down.
The Green channel (Top-Right) is more represented in the
image, since ocean water does contain greenish hues.
Finally, the Blue channel (Bottom-Left) is extremely light,
and near pure white in some locations. This is because
shades of blue are heavily represented in our image.
