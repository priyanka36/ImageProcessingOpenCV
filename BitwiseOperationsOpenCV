Four Bitwise Operations in Open Cv 
AND,OR,XORand NOT 
Very low level Operations
But are paramount To image Processing 
For Masks
They operate in a binary manner
Represented as grayscale images 
pixel = turned off if it has value 0
pixel = turned on if it has value grater than 0


As I mentioned above, a given pixel is turned “on” if it
has a value greater than zero, and it is turned “off” if it has
a value of zero. Bitwise functions operate on these binary
conditions.
In order to utilize bitwise functions, we assume (in most
cases) that we are comparing two pixels (the only exception
is the NOT function). We’ll compare each of the pixels and
then construct our bitwise representation.
Let’s quickly review our binary operations:
1. AND: A bitwise AND is true if and only if both pixels
are greater than zero.
2. OR: A bitwise OR is true if either of the two pixels
are greater than zero.
3. XOR: A bitwise XOR is true if and only if either of the
two pixels are greater than zero, but not both.
4. NOT: A bitwise NOT inverts the “on” and “off” pixels
in an image.
